title: Let's Learn about Waveforms | The Pudding
___

Go check out [this *incredible* web based visual explainer on sound waves](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/) by [Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau)[^1]. It's full of animations and sound that help to explain how sound waves, additive synthesis, and phase all work to create the sounds we hear every day. Having these concepts visually laid out like this helped me to understand the concepts more fully, even after going to audio production school for two years. Highly recommended! üëçüëç

[^1]: A quick shoutout: this link came to me from the excellent [Changelog Nightly](https://changelog.com/nightly) mailing list, a nightly email that catalogs the currently most popular open source repos on GitHub. I find cool stuff on there *every day*. And if you dig that, do check out their [weekly mailing list](https://changelog.com/weekly) too!
