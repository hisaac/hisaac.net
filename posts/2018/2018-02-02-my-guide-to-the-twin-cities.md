title: My Guide to the Twin Cities
___

I've lived in the Twin Cities since 2009, and have come to know them fairly well. Being there will be lots of people visiting from out of town this weekend — because [Minneapolis is hosting Super Bowl LII](https://www.nfl.com/super-bowl) — I've written up a guide to fun and interesting things to do in the Twin Cities.

You can check out the guide [here](/living-documents/my-guide-to-the-twin-cities.html), and it will be in the [Living Documents](/more.html#living-documents) section of the *More* page here on the site for future reference.
