I've lived in the Twin Cities since 2009, and have come to know them fairly well. Being there will be lots of people visiting from out of town this weekend — because [Minneapolis is hosting Super Bowl LII](https://www.nfl.com/super-bowl) — I've written up a guide to fun and interesting things to do in the Twin Cities.

You can check out the guide [here](/living-documents/my-guide-to-the-twin-cities.html), and it will be in the [Living Documents](/more.html#living-documents) section of the *More* page here on the site for future reference.
