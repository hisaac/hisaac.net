I’ve just undertaken a “GitHub Challenge” with fellow students at [Prime Academy](http://primeacademy.io). Our goal for the challenge is to make at least one `git commit` for the next 30 days, starting today.

We were asked to choose a topic that interested us, so I chose front-end design. I’ve heard that the curriculum at Prime will be focused more on back-end technologies, than front-end design (which makes sense), but I’m also interested in front-end, so it should be a good motivator to learn that alongside the other material.

The project I’ve chosen is to design my own Jekyll theme. I’ve named the theme *Tash* after my father’s childhood horse. (note: This blog is run off of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)[^1], and hosted on GitHub in [its own repo](http://github.com/hisaac/hisaac.github.io).) I don’t love Jekyll’s default theme, *Minima*, and I haven’t found one elsewhere that I’m in love with either. So, I’m gonna make my own!

This will be an exercise not only of learning *how* to design a good looking website, but also *what* makes a good looking website. I plan to blog here during the process, and you can check back in as I work to see how the site changes throughout.

[^1]:	This is no longer accurate. The blog now runs on [Hexo](http://hexo.io "Hexo").
