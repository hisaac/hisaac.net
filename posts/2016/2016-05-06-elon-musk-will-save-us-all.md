Since posting this, I learned that while Musk is promoting interesting and important ideas through his investing, he hasn't been nearly as involved in the actual creation of these things as he would like us to believe. If pressed, I think I'd still say that the publicity and name-recognition brought to some of his projects is a net-positive — I doubt for instance that Tesla would've been as successful without his investment and promotion — I no longer believe he is as responsible for "saving us all" as I was when I initially wrote this.

I have a theory about Elon Musk: I believe he has foreseen the inevitable destruction of the human race through its continued ravaging of the Earth.

Musk plans to have [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com "SpaceX") ready to usher humans off of this planet, and onto another (Mars? the Moon?). The technology though, is not there yet. What he needs is more time.

With [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com "Tesla"), [SolarCity](http://www.solarcity.com "SolarCity"), [The Boring Company](https://www.boringcompany.com "The Boring Company"), and [his version](http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop "Hyperloop \| SpaceX") of the [Hyperloop concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop "Hyperloop - Wikipedia"), he is helping the world become less dependent on fossil fuels —  thereby delaying the inevitable destruction of this place we call home.
