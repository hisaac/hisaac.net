title: Quiver: The Programmer's Notebook
___

[Quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver) is a new favorite app of mine. It's essentially Evernote for programmers. It gives you the ability to write notes containing styled text, Markdown, code, and even LaTex. It's Mac only right now, but an iOS version is currently in beta testing.
