Iâ€™ve had [dandruff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandruff) for most of my adult life. Iâ€™ve more or less come to accept it, but during my recent trip to Seattle to see my doctor, I casually mentioned it to her. Her response was to prescribe me selenium sulfide shampoo. If youâ€™ve ever used [Selsun Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selsun_Blue), youâ€™ve used selenium sulfide shampoo. Selsun Blue contains 1% selenium sulfide as an active ingredient. The prescription I was given has 2.25%.

Iâ€™ve used Selsun Blue in the past, and it didnâ€™t help me. I was skeptical, but the fact that this was prescription strength made me interested. Lo and behold, it worked! After only one use, my dandruff has quite literally disappeared. Itâ€™s incredible.

<aside>There used to be a Vine video here of me running my fingers through my hair to prove there was no dandruff, but it got disappeared when Vine got shuttered. ðŸ˜¢ I guess you'll just have to trust me.</aside>

Dandruff is excess dead skin flaking off of the scalp. It can have [many causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandruff#Causes), so it can sometimes be difficult to treat. Selenium sulfide is an anti-fungal agent, so at least in my case, the dandruff seems to have been caused by a problem with the microorganisms on my scalp. Most likely metabolic by-products of Malassezia yeasts (according to the Wikipedia article).

So, if you have dandruff and are seeking a solution, ask your doctor about prescription strength selenium sulfide shampoo (I know this sounds like an advertisementâ€¦). It's worked for me so far, but Iâ€™ll make sure to post an update here if things change.
