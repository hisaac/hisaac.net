title: Fake News and Instagram | Manton Reece

[Manton Reece](http://www.manton.org/2016/11/fake-news-and-instagram.html):

> It’s not easy to build software that encourages good behavior. When I look at my Instagram timeline I see beautiful photos, hand-drawn art, and snapshots of everyday life. I see the very best of the world. **It’s not the full truth, but it’s all true.**

I really like Manton's point here, that sometimes making something difficult to do promotes higher quality output. It extends outward into the rest of life as well.
