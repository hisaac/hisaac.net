title: Solo Project: Finished
___

I may have fell off the bandwagon with updating this blog with my solo project status, but rest assured, I did finish the project.

While the app didn't end up quite as great as I'd imagined (I doubt it ever would've), I'm proud of what I built. I also learned a lot about OAuth, MongoDB, REST APIs, and CSS.

You can check out the code for the project at [Crow's GitHub Page](https://github.com/hisaac/Crow).
