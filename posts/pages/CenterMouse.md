CenterMouse is a simple macOS utility app. It runs silently in the background, and responds to certain events — wake from sleep, exit screensaver, custom keyboard shortcut — by moving the mouse pointer to the center of your primary display.

This is helpful for those of us that have multiple monitors, making it easy and predictable to know where the mouse pointer will be when coming back to your computer.

CenterMouse is open source, and 100% free to download and use!
