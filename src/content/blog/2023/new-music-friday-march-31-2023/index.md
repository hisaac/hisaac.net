Here's the music that came out today that I was excited for, and a brief review of each one.

[<cite>The Postlude</cite> by A$AP Ant](https://album.link/i/1677198478)
:	★☆☆☆☆ Not worth your time.

[<cite>All Roads Lead Home</cite> by Molina, Talbot, Lofgren, and [Neil] Young](https://album.link/i/1672110045)
:	★★☆☆☆ Meh.

[<cite>Lies</cite> by LIES](https://liesband.bandcamp.com/album/lies)
:	★★★☆☆ It's pretty good, but definitely worth a listen if you're a fan of American Football.

[<cite>The Great Escape</cite> by Larry June & The Alchemist](https://album.link/i/1677236538)
:	★★★★☆ One of the better hip-hop albums I've heard in a while!
