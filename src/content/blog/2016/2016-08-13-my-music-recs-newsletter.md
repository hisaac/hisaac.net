I've decided to try out the email newsletter format as a way to send out music recommendations. I love the discovery of new music almost as much as I love the music itself, so I thought it would be a fun way to help others discover great stuff.

I haven't decided yet if I'll post the recs here on the blog as well, but I'd say it's pretty likely that I will.
