# Quick Tip: How to Enable CarPlay in the iOS Simulator

This little tip was surprisingly hard to find — only mentioned a couple times online — so I figured I'd do my part to spread the word.

To enable CarPlay in Xcode's iOS simulator, execute the following terminal command:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.iphonesimulator CarPlay -bool YES
```

Restart the simulator if it was currently running, and then in the menu bar, go to `Hardware > External Displays > CarPlay`.

Easy peasy.
