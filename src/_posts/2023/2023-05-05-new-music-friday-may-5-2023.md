# New Music Friday: May 5, 2023

There were some great new releases this New Music Friday!

## <cite>Failed at Math(s)</cite> by Panchiko

This is Panchiko's first true full-length, and it's surprisingly good for a band that hasn't been active for over 25 years.

## <cite>Into You / Void In Blue</cite> by Glare

This is a remastered set of Glare's first 2 EPs, which I'd never heard before. Itâ€™s some _excellent_ shoegaze.

## <cite>Bend Into a Blur</cite> by Clearbody

Clearbody announced this new EP releasing in June, and dropped the first single. I loved their debut album [<cite>One More Day</cite>](https://clearbody.bandcamp.com/album/one-more-day-2), so I'm very excited for this one.
