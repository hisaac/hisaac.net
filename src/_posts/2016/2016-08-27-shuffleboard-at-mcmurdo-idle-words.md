# Shuffleboard at McMurdo | Idle Words

Maciej Cegłowski (creator of [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in)) [crowdfunded a trip to Antarctica](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/431908798/send-idle-words-to-antarctica), with the promise of writing in detail about the experience. <cite>[Shuffleboard at McMurdo](http://idlewords.com/2016/05/shuffleboard_at_mcmurdo.htm)</cite> is his first delivery on that promise, and it does not disappoint.

I didn't know until after reading this post that Cegłowski has been writing for a long time, and is particularly well known for his travel writing. His blog has a lot of other gems worth checking out if you get the time.
