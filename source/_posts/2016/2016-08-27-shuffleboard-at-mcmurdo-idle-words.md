Maciej Cegłowski (creator of [Pinboard][1]) [crowdfunded a trip to Antarctica][2], with the promise of writing in detail about the experience. <cite>[Shuffleboard at McMurdo][3]</cite> is his first delivery on that promise, and it does not disappoint.

I didn't know until after reading this post that Cegłowski has been writing for a long time, and is particularly well known for his travel writing. His blog has a lot of other gems worth checking out if you get the time.
