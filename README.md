# hisaac.net

This repo contains the code my personal webpage and blog, [hisaac.net](http://hisaac.net).

The site is automatically generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a great little static site generator that runs on Ruby. I use Jekyll so that I can write my blog posts in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and still retain the ability to create a dynamic, easily updatable, and easily customizable weblog. It's also just fun to tinker with.
