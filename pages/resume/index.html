				<h3>Target</h3>

				<h4>Senior iOS Platform Engineer (April 2021 – present)</h4>

				<p>
					While at Jamf, I developed an interest in development tooling and automation. Joining Target's iOS Platform team gave me an opportunity to learn more about "platform" development — the intersection of app development and devops. Target already had a mature and well-developed process, so joining their team meant I could learn existing best-practices and build from that foundation.
				</p>

				<details>
					<ul>
						<li>Quickly learned how to use and modify Target's multiple in-house and third party build and development tools.</li>
						<li>During my first month at Target, I delivered an important update to Target's complex and custom Bazel integration to support Xcode 12.5, keeping the developers on the most recent development tools available.</li>
