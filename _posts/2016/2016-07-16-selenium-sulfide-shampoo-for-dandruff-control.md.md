I’ve had [dandruff][1] for most of my adult life. I’ve more or less come to accept it, but during my recent trip to Seattle to see my doctor, I casually mentioned it to her. Her response was to prescribe me selenium sulfide shampoo. If you’ve ever used [Selsun Blue][2], you’ve used selenium sulfide shampoo. Selsun Blue contains 1% selenium sulfide as an active ingredient. The prescription I was given has 2.25%.

I’ve used Selsun Blue in the past, and it didn’t help me. I was skeptical, but the fact that this was prescription strength made me interested. Lo and behold, it worked! After only one use, my dandruff has quite literally disappeared. It’s incredible.

<aside>There used to be a [Vine video here][3] of me running my fingers through my hair to prove there was no dandruff, but it got disappeared when Vine got shuttered. 😢 I guess you'll just have to trust me.</aside>

Dandruff is excess dead skin flaking off of the scalp. It can have [many causes][4], so it can sometimes be difficult to treat. Selenium sulfide is an anti-fungal agent, so at least in my case, the dandruff seems to have been caused by a problem with the microorganisms on my scalp. Most likely metabolic by-products of Malassezia yeasts (according to the Wikipedia article).

So, if you have dandruff and are seeking a solution, ask your doctor about prescription strength selenium sulfide shampoo (I know this sounds like an advertisement…). It's worked for me so far, but I’ll make sure to post an update here if things change.
