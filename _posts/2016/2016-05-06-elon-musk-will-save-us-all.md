I have a theory about Elon Musk: I believe he has foreseen the inevitable destruction of the human race through its continued ravaging of the Earth.

Musk plans to have [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com "SpaceX") ready to usher humans off of this planet, and onto another (Mars? the Moon?). The technology though, is not there yet. What he needs is more time.

With [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com "Tesla"), [SolarCity](http://www.solarcity.com "SolarCity"), [The Boring Company](https://www.boringcompany.com "The Boring Company"), and [his version](http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop "Hyperloop | SpaceX") of the [Hyperloop concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop "Hyperloop - Wikipedia"), he is helping the world become less dependent on fossil fuels —  thereby delaying the inevitable destruction of this place we call home.
