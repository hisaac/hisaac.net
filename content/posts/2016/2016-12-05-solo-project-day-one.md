Today, I started work on my solo project, a major component of the curriculum at [Prime Academy](http://primeacademy.io). For my project, I've decided to build a simple Twitter application. Heavily inspired by the late [Birdhouse](http://birdhouseapp.com) iOS app, it is a place to craft tweets, store them for later posting as drafts, and post them to Twitter once they are perfect.

Here is the project scope document I created for the project: [Crow Project Scope](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17EUIFvcU5Hg-axvDmtTtoNeCzHPXpkBbMduVAJ4DLDU/edit?usp=sharing)

There are a few reasons I chose the name Crow.

1. I wanted something bird themed because Twitter.
2. Crows have one of the best memories in the ornithological world.
3. The word *crow* can also be used to describe the action of making a sound expressing happiness or triumph, or to describe the sound itself. You can imagine each tweet made within Crow as a *crow* in itself.
